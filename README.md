## Overview

This is a simple landing page of an e-commerce consulting site that focuses on correct utilization of front-end base tools - HTML and CSS.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View hover effects on interactive elements such as links, buttons, FAQ accordions and mobile burger menu
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size (mobile in this case)
- Receive basic feedback of incorrect data inputs through basic html input validation

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://soposilverhawk.github.io/HTML-CSS-module-exam/]

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS framework
- SCSS (SASS syntax)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learned how to properly implement bootstrap framework into my code and make it work well with my custom css files. Apart from that, I learned how to work with SASS/SCSS nested syntax, how to create general mixins for repeated styles and implement conditional rendering for different elements of the same classes. Furthermore, I learned how to review my code for refactoring purposes after investigating for ways to write cleaner code


### Continued development

While working on the project, I realized that I can further improve my understanding of generalising styling logic to follow DRY principles as much as possible. Apart from that, I have not utilized extends in SASS/SCSS much which can serve as further learning in the follow projects.
